# android-monumentos
Android Studio project. The first screen displays data from a randomly selected monument from an ArrayList containing several monuments. 
It also features two buttons: 'Show Another' to display another random monument from the ArrayList, and a 'Detail' button to navigate
to a second screen displaying all the data related to the current monument shown on the first screen. 
The project takes into account translated strings and handles both portrait and landscape activity orientations."
